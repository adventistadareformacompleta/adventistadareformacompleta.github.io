				<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first day of the week was Sunday. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the first clear reference to a worship meeting of Christians on that day, although worship on Sundays had certainly become common practice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although some maintain that they met on Saturday afternoon, as the Jewish day began at 6:00 pm, the previous afternoon, there is no evidence that Luke used the Jewish method of computing the time when narrating events that took place in Hellenistic environments, but rather the Roman method, which counted the day from midnight to midnight. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To break bread is a reference to the holy supper. </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Archeological Studies Bible, p. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1810</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>
  
<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The text of Acts 20:7, does not mention at any time that there was a change from Saturday to Sunday, as a day of observance, it simply mentions that on Sunday they were gathered together to break bread. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, we cannot ignore that in Paul's time the days were counted from sunset to sunset, according to the biblical calendar and not from midnight to midnight as the Gregorian calendar says, which did not exist at the time, so, Sunday night would be Saturday night. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The question is to find out if the apostolic church celebrated Holy Communion, Sunday or on the 14th day of Abib of the Jewish month, a quarter of the thirtieth day and we know what it means to break bread, therefore, it is convenient to </font></font><a title="scour" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">search</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> the Scriptures to </font></font><a title="to clarify" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">elucidate</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> the controversy.</font></font></p> 

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Given the insistence of Evangelicals, Catholics and Spiritualists who advocate the cause of Sunday, claiming that Acts 20:7 is overwhelming proof of the change in the day of worship, they claim that on that day Paul celebrated a Holy Supper, because Sunday is the day of worship, as seen in the text extracted from the archaeological Bible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, they forget that the Holy Supper was instituted by Jesus on the night he was delivered. </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The day has come for the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover must be celebrated" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Luke 22:7</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Indeed, it is necessary to turn to the Old Testament to discover this date. </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The Passover of the Lord, which begins in the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month.

 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to better understand the meaning of the peace offering, one can see in the Scriptures, read, when cases of disharmony, misunderstandings, rivalries were overcome and there was reconciliation, a peace offering and a banquet were offered where everyone fraternized in the presence of the Lord, priests, conflicting people, their families, neighbors and friends. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The early church followed this pattern, celebrating the feast of Agape, or the feast of love, also called in Acts 20:7, the breaking of bread. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The worship of the early church was communion services. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The peace offering had this power, to pacify, to promote reconciliation, the divine nature reigned sovereign in the hearts of God's servants with its peculiar fruits of communion, it celebrated justification, man at peace with God. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The shared meal illustrated mutual communion with God and with the brothers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this particular, this offer was different from all the others. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Andreasen's illuminating accounts:</font></font></p> 


 
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As previously stated, the peace offering was a communion offering in which God, the priest and the person took part. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was a common meal, taken in the temple precinct, where joy and contentment prevailed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was not an occasion on which peace was effected, but a feast of rejoicing at the possession of it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was usually preceded by a sin offering or a burnt offering. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Atonement had been made, blood had been sprinkled, forgiveness had been granted, and justification had been secured. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To celebrate this, the offerer invited his close relatives and his servants, as well as the Levites, to eat with him (Deuteronomy 12:17-18). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And so the whole family gathered within the doors of the temple to celebrate in a festive way the peace that had been established between God and man, and between man and man.</font></font><br>

 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The focus of the peace offering was to maintain communion with God and with each other, justification by faith reconciles us to God, we have peace with God, so it was a representation of the righteousness of Christ in the hearts of believers through the peace offering, see the which asserts the following text from Andreasen's work:</font></font></p> 

 
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rom. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5:1. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He is our peace Ephesians. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2:14. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Israel of old were invited to celebrate their peace with God, the forgiveness of the sinner, and their being restored to divine favor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This celebration included son and daughter, servant and servant, the Levite. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All sat at the Lord's table and rejoiced together in hope of the glory of God. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the same way we ought to glory in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now achieved reconciliation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Romans 5:2 and 11                                 </font></font><br>

 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the foot of the Archaeological Study Bible, p. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1810, a reference note is carved explaining Acts 20:7, confirming that the early church held communion meetings, or breaking of bread, as doctrine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Including, explaining that the Corinthian believers confused the communion meeting with the Holy Supper.</font></font></p> 

 
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“1 Corinthians 11:17... Sharing meals was a crucial part of the life of the early church. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jesus set an example by gladly welcoming all who came to the fellowship of the table. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The early church continued this practice, and members often met in homes to share food (eg, Acts 2:42). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Certain Jewish and Greco-Roman religious associations also gathered to participate in communal meals, and sometimes behavior in pagan environments was out of order. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For Christians, however, the meal shared a powerful symbol of their love in Christ, so that it came to be called the “love feast” (Gr. agape; lit. one love) The word is used this way in the NT only in Jude 12.</font></font><br>
<br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jesus also instituted the Eucharist (or Lord's Supper), and its relationship with the feast of love is difficult; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Was it one or two events? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most likely answer is that in the early church no marked distinction was made between the two. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The eucharist was probably celebrated in the context of an ecclesiastical meal, just as the first eucharist was celebrated in the context of the Passover Supper. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It soon became evident, however, that it was unwise to combine the two: When you come together, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper, for each one eats his own supper without waiting for the others. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So while one is hungry, another is drunk (1 Cor. 11:20-21). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the following centuries, the Lord's Supper was separated from the communal meal, and the love feast tradition began to disappear. </font></font><br>

 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Feast of Love or Agape or Breaking bread was a powerful tool to consolidate communion in the Church, which remained pure, was a filter against the greedy, greedy and devouring wolves, this practice lasted until the Council of Nicaea, when Constantine pretended to be converted, the bloody persecutions against Christians certainly ended, however, something worse happened in the community church. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The communion meetings, Agape or Feast of Love or Breaking the Bread, were annihilated at that council. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Constantine's attitude against the doctrine of the Early Church manifested itself in two cruel ways, one was the change of the day of worship from Saturday to Sunday and the other perhaps with worse consequences was the change of the Church from the Communion to the Institutional Church.</font></font></p> 
 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the union of church and state, there was division, the sincere did not remain in the church, the Waldensian dissidents took refuge in the mountains of Italy and Switzerland, where they kept the Sabbath and kept the true doctrine intact and the Christian communion, for more than a thousand years, even persecuted by Catholicism. </font><font class="" style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the mother church, which once ruled Christian communion, gave way to the Institutional church, which does not value communion with God and with each other, but rather, heritage, the doctrine of temporal prosperity, formalism and ceremonialism as the mass, worship of the dead, lacking in spiritual life, temples filled with pomp, relics supported by the civil power, with that, a door was opened for the avaricious, corrupt, opportunists who spared no effort to supplant any doctrine contrary to their spurious purposes,</font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The dragon was wroth with the woman and went out to make war against the rest of her offspring, those who obey the commandments of God and hold fast to the testimony of Jesus" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Revelation 12:17</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.  </font></font></p>
