However, I started a thorough Bible study on the subject and with the help of a brother, I was able to obtain the correct biblical understanding on the subject". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The end of the research resulted in ignoring the divine order and following the human order, satisfying the desires of the natural, sinful heart, he reasoned that wearing a beard as a precept: "But this is not the teaching of the Scriptures. beard, for personal choice or otherwise, but not because the Bible commands.

			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Joseph was Pharaoh's slave and prisoner, all who were summoned by the ruler of Egypt had to present themselves clean shaven, dressed in clean clothes and </font></font><a title="elegant, tidy" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">clean</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The question under discussion </font></font><a title="force" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">compels</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> us to </font></font><a title="understand" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">infer</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , that Pharaoh's order was a law, no matter whose hand it was that used the blade that removed Joseph's beard, whether it was he or an officer of Pharaoh, it is certain that he had to present himself shaved and </font></font><a title="elegant, tidy" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">clean</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Joseph had no choice in this particular. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although some brothers claimed that Joseph could choose to keep his beard, as he chose not to sin against Potiphar's wife in order not to break God's Law. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When Joseph resisted temptation, avoiding committing adultery, he was not a prisoner, he was a privileged slave and he was fulfilling a direct order, from God and Potiphar, who delivered his entire house into his hands, except for his wife. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While in prison he was a prisoner sentenced for a crime, even though he was innocent, he was subject to the rigors of the hive and suffered in the first days until God softened his misfortune, so in the first case he had a choice and chose to do the right thing, in the second case he enjoyed no choice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, this precept, in the days of Joseph, was passed from father to son,</font></font></p>

			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As we can see, the brother continues his arguments: "Another evidence that the wearing of a beard is not a divine requirement for the men among His people is the fact that in the book of Leviticus itself the Lord recommends that the beard be shaved in some cases for health reasons. He coined some texts to prove that God is forbidding his people to wear a beard": 
			 </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"And when a man (or woman) has a plague on his head or beard, the priest will examine the plague, and if it appears deeper the skin, and there is fine yellow hair on it, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is itch, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Leviticus 13:29-30</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>

			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Following the brother's line of reasoning, wearing a beard is a sign of sin, the believer needs to purify himself, and for that, it is necessary to shave his beard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If this thesis is true, all believers will be compelled to shave their beards, heads and eyebrows in order to present themselves to the Sovereign of the purified Universe. </font></font><a title="probably, maybe" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , this is why evangelical churches, contaminated with the leprosy of sin (secularism) adopt shaving men's beards and heads and sisters' eyebrows.</font></font></p>
			
			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is certain, however, that God forbids his people to cut or damage their beards, as seen:
			 </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"You shall not cut your hair, rounding the corners of your head, nor disfigure the corners of your beard. You shall not make lacerations in your flesh for the dead. ; neither shall you put any mark on your body. I am the Lord" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Leviticus 19:27-28</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Except in the case of leprosy, the only permission to shave the beard, head, eyebrows and all hair was a divine order:
			</font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Then the LORD said to Moses, This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought to the priest, and he shall go forth outside the camp, and examine him; if the leper's plague is healed... He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, shave all his hair, and wash himself in water; he shall be clean. Then he shall enter the camp, but he shall be outside his tent for seven days. On the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair, both the head and the beard and the eyebrows, yea, he shall shave off all his hair; he shall also wash his garments, and bathe his body in water; so shall he be clean." </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Leviticus 14:1-3, 8-9</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, it deserves to be clarified that after the period of purification, sins were purged and the servant of God was allowed to grow a beard again, those who shave their drools are because they are lepers, and if they never let their beards grow it is a sign of that the leprosy of sin continues in his heart, in this situation indeed, he has to shave his beard.</font></font></p>
			
	

			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth clarifying here, that leprosy is a sign of sin and not the beard, sin is the transgression of the Law of God, we have the example of Miriam who rebelled against the divine order, accusing Moses: 
			 </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"When the cloud departed from the tent, Miriam she was leprous; her appearance was like snow. Aaron turned to her, and saw that she had leprosy" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Numbers 12:9-10</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Surely she completed the period of purification, then returned to the camp of Israel purified. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the same vein </font></font><a title="manner" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">,</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> are the teachings of Sister White, who ratifies leprosy as a sin deserving divine punishment:</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of all the diseases known in the East, leprosy was the most feared. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Its incurable and contagious character, its terrible effect on victims, filled the most valiant with fear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among the Jews, it was considered a judgment on sin, being therefore called: "the scourge", "the finger of God". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deeply rooted, mortal, it was held to be a symbol of sin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The ritual law declared the leper unclean. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a person already dead, he was excluded from the dwellings of men. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything he touched was filthy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The air was polluted by his breath. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A person suspected of this disease had to present himself to the priests, who had to examine and decide the case. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Being declared a leper, he was separated from his family, isolated from the congregation of Israel, and condemned to live only with those afflicted with the same evil. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The law was adamant in its demands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The kings and principals themselves were not exempt. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A king attacked by this terrible disease, had to renounce the scepter and flee from society.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Separated from friends and relatives, the leper was to suffer the curse of his infirmity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He was obliged to publish his own disgrace, to rip off their dresses, to sound the alarm, warning everyone to flee from his contaminating presence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cry "unclean! unclean!" </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">given in plaintive tones by the poor exile, it was a signal heard with fear and loathing. </font></font><br>

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If Israel kept all of God's Commandments, Statutes and Precepts, it was a condition, they were under God's protection and free from leprosy, disease or any plague:

	 </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"They shall not shave their heads, nor let their hair grow. hair, but they shall shear their heads as they should" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ezekiel 44:20</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the text in question, the Lord is commanding to clip the hair without rounding, and not to trim the beard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Indeed, it is a pity that boastful pastors trim their beards and teach their members to follow their bad examples based on this text, surely it is a forced interpretation taken out of its legitimate context, to feed the sinful nature of their carnal hearts.</font></font></p>
	
	<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is imperative to point out that in biblical times, men who rounded their beards or who wore only a goatee were worshipers of Bacchus, Baal and other pagan deities, just like the men who trim their beards in modern times, also offer sacrifices under the altar. fashion, cherishing idols in their hearts, claim to meet social demands formulated by men at the expense of divine precept, </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"for they have changed the truth of God into a lie, worshiping and serving the creature instead of the Creator, who is blessed forever" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Romans 1:25</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>
	
				
			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Law forbids offering sacrifice to the defective Creator. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The beard is no different, clipping, shaving or mutilating the beard is a defective offering when used by precept. </font></font><a title="studying, investigating, researching" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Searching</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> the Scriptures, we see that men with mutilated beards were prevented from presenting themselves before God, they did not even enter Jerusalem, the center of worship to the Lord, as can be seen in the case of David's servants who had their clothes torn and beards mutilated. :

			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Considering the value that the beard had for the servants of the one God, with this act, the king of the Ammonites unleashed a true declaration of war, cutting the beard of a Jew was a lethal insult, in the present case it could only be avenged with the war, as it happened.</font></font></p>
			
			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth noting that it was not the exposure of their buttocks that shamed those men, but the mutilation of their beards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Clothes could be replaced, however, the beard takes time to grow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">David's instruction to them was that they should remain in Jericho until the beard was in the norm, and then return to Jerusalem, they could not enter the city of the great king or even his presence with the beards mangled, this is overwhelming proof, God does not accept his servants mutilating or trimming their beards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">David defeated the Ammonites and the Syrians; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">that war was broken out because of the mutilation of the beards of the servants of God.</font></font></p>
			
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Indeed, in case of sorrow, affliction, pain and desolation, the servants of God, tore their clothes, did not fix their beards in total carelessness carried away by the pain of their afflictions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have two examples, the first case is Miphibosheth, son of Jonathan, grandson of King Saul, who was adopted by King David, we read: 
				 </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"And Mephibosheth, son of Saul, went down to meet the king, and He had not washed his feet, nor shaved his beard, nor washed his clothes from the day the king went out until the day he returned in peace." </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2 Samuel 19:24</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Miphibosheth's pain comes from the injustice suffered by David, when he ran away from his son Absalom who commanded part of the army, with the aim of defeating and killing his father. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the text in question, it can be seen that Miphibosheth did not wash his feet, nor his clothes, nor fix his beard, in total carelessness, in terms of personal hygiene, as a sign of deep sadness shared by the misfortunes suffered by David. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although some pastors claim that Miphibosheth did not shave, signaling that he did not trim his beard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is well known that it was not customary for the Jews to trim their beards because it was a defective offering before the sovereign of the universe, as seen in Sister White's text:</font></font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The marked contrast between the high priest and Christ, was in the ostentation and rich robes, however, they were similar as to not trimming the beard, which commanded respect from the Hebrews. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The high priest was an example, such that the precious oil of his anointing that ran down his (beard) over the collar of his robe: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"It is like precious oil on the head, which runs down to the beard, Aaron's beard, and goes down to the collar of his garment" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Psalm 133:2</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">   In the second example, it is noted that not caring, pulling out the hair from one's head or from one's own beard was a sign of great bitterness, as seen with Ezra when he learned that the children of Israel were backslidden and refused to separate from the pagan peoples, including contracting marriages with his daughters: 
				 </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"When I heard such a thing, I tore my robe and my robe, and plucked the hair from my head and from my beard, and sat down astonished" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ezra 9:3</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In neither case are we allowed to trim or shave our beards, on the contrary, the Scriptures teach that we must strive for cleanliness, keeping the beard clean and </font></font><a title="uncontaminated" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unharmed</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> from any artifice that damages it.</font></font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The prophet Ezekiel should take a barber's razor or a sword and use it as a razor, in fact they were a symbol of devastation wrought by an enemy army that would afflict the people, in this case the Babylonians. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Adventist Bible Dictionary explains that the shaving of the beard by the prophet means that:</font></font></p>
				
<blockquote>

				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, it was forbidden not only for priests, but for any Jew to shave his head or beard, except in the case of leprosy.</font></font></p>
				
			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is good to note the picture of God's judgment on his people, Israel, as a razor passed over the beard of the entire nation is an intentional portrayal of a disgrace and an extremely severe judgment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When God wanted to show and indicate the severity of His judgment on His people because of sin and idolatry, He did so using the analogy of shaving their most beloved symbol—the beard. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the greatest indignity that could be done to a Jew was to pluck his beard—a sure sign of God's judgment is to have his beard plucked. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you want to understand what was done with the Lord Jesus Christ, you must understand this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When our Lord was made our substitute and suffered in our stead, we read:</font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I have turned my back to those who beat me, my face to those who plucked my beard; I have not hidden my face from mockery and spitting" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Isaiah 50:6</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>

He condemned in his book "O Pedagogo" the use of earrings, makeup, jewelry, eye and hair painting, he probably wrote more about the evils of removing the beard than all other early Christian authors combined. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like the Jews, Clement called the beard "man's natural adornment" and said that it was "never permissible" to shave it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(The Fathers of the Church, 218). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Beards are numbered," Clement warns his readers: "To look for beauty in the smooth, hairless face is sheer effeminacy, if done by a man." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(The Fathers of the Church, 215). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"God designed a woman to have smooth and smooth skin, taking pride in the natural locks of her hair, like a horse with its crest," Clement wrote.</font></font></p>

So it is a kind of impiety, and a crime against nature , destroy that sign of masculinity (the beard). Such things, therefore, are not expedient for Christians.

				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The primitive Church used the beard as a norm, to make a difference from other peoples who mutilated their beards according to the demand of worship of their pagan gods, they welcomed the teachings of the Lord who says: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"It is to make a difference between the saint and the profane and between the unclean and the clean" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Leviticus 10:10</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just as the firstborn were set apart for the Lord, wearing a beard meant submission to God. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A man without a beard or a clean-shaven face indicated that he was a slave and that he was in submission to another man. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, being deprived of a beard was, and still is in some places in the East, a badge of servitude — a mark of infamy, which degraded the individual among other men to the level of slaves and women.</font></font></p>
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For this reason, Clement of Alexandria strongly taught that the Christian should wear a beard as a precept, and portrayed it as a sign of virility, strength and power:</font></font></p>

<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Men, as well as lions, were adorned with the beard and granted them virility as a sign of strength and power. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So he also adorned the cocks that fight in defense of the hens with their crests, as if they were helmets. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But so high is the esteem that God professes for these hairs that are born in the faces of men, that he makes them born together with prudence, and delighting in his majestic wisdom, he honored the gravity of the aspect with senile gray. </font></font><br>

</blockquote>					
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He urges to highlight yet another proof that it was strictly forbidden to shave the beard in the early church:</font></font></p>
				
				
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is not lawful to shave the beard, which is natural beauty, noble beauty, "who is originally bearded and whose puberty is full of charm"... It is necessary that those who have received a correct education and in whom peace resides, leave their own beard calm. . </font></font><br>

</blockquote>					
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Clement, once again enriches us with his teachings from the apostles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We cannot forget that he met and lived with some brothers who continued their work in the apostolic church, such as Polycarpo. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The teachings of the apostles were Polycarp's source of knowledge, following these teachings he said:</font></font></p>
				
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is not lawful to shave oneself; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the natural beauty of someone starting to grow a mustache is gracefully in the bloom of youth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And now advanced in age, he anoints his beard radiantly, on which the prophetic perfume of the venerable Aaron descended. </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Clement of Alexandria (AD 195) The Pedagogue, page 245</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>						
				
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tertullian follows the line of teaching of the early Church Fathers, asserting that men shave their beards out of vanity, as well as damage it, in the shape of a goatee, by cutting it around the mouth:</font></font></p>
				
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Men have their own vanities and mistakes as well as shaving the beard very straight, shaving off parts and shaving around the mouth. </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tertullian (AD 197)</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>

			
			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cyprian, another Patristic, taught that cutting the beard is a pagan custom, so Christians did not have this infamous custom:</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among his customs (of the heathen) he had no discipline. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among men the beards were shaved. </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cyprian (250 AD)</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As for the Christians he commanded to keep the precept of God, wearing the beard without damaging it, as can be seen:</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The beard must not be shaved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Don't clip your beard." </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cyprian (250 AD)</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>
				
					
				
<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When he says: do not shave your beards, he is clearly ordering you not to trim your beard, as some insist on damaging by claiming cleanliness, when in fact he is feeding the vanity that slumbers in your carnal heart.</font></font></p>
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, Clement of Alexandria teaches how to cut the mustache and justifies:</font></font></p>
				
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also the mustache, for reasons of cleanliness when eating, the ends are cut with scissors, but without shaving it, which would be unseemly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And without touching the beard of the jaws. </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Clement of Alexandria (AD 195)</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>				
				
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note that Clement forbids cutting the hair of the jaws, which for some religious is not a beard, they claim that they cannot cut the side locks, that the jaws are not a beard, therefore it can be trimmed, according to Clement's teachings, and he has the authority to do so. , the jaws are beards like all the hairs on the face and cannot be shorn or shaved, remember, Jesus counted them all.</font></font></p>
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To annihilate any remaining doubt that the early church used the beard as a norm, it is convenient to invoke the Council of Carthage, promoted by the early church in approximately 200 AD, which met to discuss and try to resolve many doctrinal problems in the church, among them were the clothing and the beard.</font></font></p>
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here is a quote from the Council of Carthage on immodest attire:</font></font></p>
				
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Any man who comes to church with long hair and a clean-shaven face will be excluded from communion, for that man is immodestly dressed. </font></font><br>

</blockquote>				
				
				
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Fourth Council of Carthage, held in AD 398, based on Scripture, decreed: "The clergyman shall not grow his hair, nor remove his beard." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the use of beards by Christians in the early church was the norm, the decision of the fourth council of Carthage is an irrefutable proof of this truth, as it is in harmony with the Scriptures, which says: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"You shall not cut your hair, rounding the corners of your head, nor disfigure the corners of your beard" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Leviticus 19:27</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We went on to study the servants of God of the 16th century Protestant Reformation and the 18th and 19th century spiritual revival. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Luther set a precedent by growing a beard, and virtually all European reformers deliberately grew their beards out of proximity to the early church and as a sign of rejection of the Catholic church, with the clerical beard becoming a recognized norm in England and throughout the Reformation. .</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It was in the 16th century that the Great Awakening took place and came to be known as the Reformation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In 1517, Martin Luther posted his 95 theses on the door of the castle church in Wittenberg, Germany, and began preaching that "the just shall live by faith." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very observable that whenever the Word of God helped to captivate the thoughts of the servants of God, they were compelled to enlighten the world with the principles of the early church; thus, in the Protestant Reformation men began to wear shorn hair and leave the beard. growing up, according to the doctrinal teachings of the apostles of Jesus, had had the early church as a mirror.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
A contemporary of Luther, the English Reformer Rowland Taylor, was pastor of the town of Hadley, fed his flock with true doctrine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to Foxe, (The Book of Martyrs, 191). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Taylor had maintained in his community the pious service and reform of King Edward VI, and with the utmost fidelity and zeal preached against the Papist corruption, which had infected all the territory around him." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the death of King Edward VI, he was persecuted and condemned as a heretic by the Papist bishops who manipulated Queen Mary, who replaced King Edward VI, who was his brother.</font></font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rowland Taylor, prayed on his knees and hands raised, as seen:</font></font></p>
				
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the bishop called his subordinates and said: _ Remove this guy from here and take him to the King's court. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tell the jailer to watch him closely. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Then, dropping to his knees and raising his hands, said Dr. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taylor: _ Holy God, I thank you...

				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As might be expected, the cruel and diabolical papist bishops put him to death in the year of our Lord 1555 for pointing out the errors and idolatries of the pope. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reformer Rowland Taylor wore a beard as the norm, just as Luther's reform inspired them.</font></font></p>

			<p align="justify">Outro grande reformador escocês foi George Wishart, professor da universidade de Cambridge, Inglaterra, geralmente chamado de mestre George da Faculdade de Benet. Enquanto viveu não permitiu que as trevas de Roma infectasse a Escócia. Foi traído por um membro de seu rebanho chamado de John Lander, acusado diante do bispo romano, como era de esperar, mestre George defendeu a verdade até o último suspiro. No momento do seu martírio ele perdoou e beijou o carrasco responsável por sua execução.</p>

			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This great reformer, like the others, also wore a long beard, they were not in the habit of damaging the tip of their beards, John Foxe, thus describes the master George:</font></font></p>

<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I like Loughborough's preaching, but I am sorry to see him following the fashions of the day. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In what sense? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">asked Sister White. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
"Because," said the woman, "in the form of shaving his beard. He leaves a mustache over his upper lips, and a goatee on his chin." </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
Mrs. White replied, "If that's all your trouble with him, I can ease his mind at the same time. He doesn't shave at all. He lets all the beard grow that God has given him, and I suppose when the Lord gives him more, he'll let that grow, too." </font></font><br>

	<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is clear from his photograph that he heeded Sister White's teachings to keep his beard in accordance with divine precept.</font></font></p>
	
	<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Truth cannot be kept in darkness forever, even the holders of White depositaries, doing everything to hide not only this one, but other present truths always leave a glimmer of light to illuminate the thirsty for knowledge, who wish to live and enjoy. as a matter of fact. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These texts indeed show that pioneer Adventists wore beards by precept, although nominal Adventists go to great lengths to cover up and denigrate this great unpopular truth.</font></font></p>

               <h2 align="center" class="label-info scroll_effect fadeInUp animated" style="visibility: visible;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">WHO REMOVED THE CHURCH BEARD PRECEPT?</font></font></h2> 
					   <p>
                 </p>
				 
				 
				 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among the nations of antiquity, Egypt stands out for the intolerance of wearing a beard, Egyptian laws forbade men to grow beards, forced their slaves to shave their beards, including Joseph. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As we know Egypt, in a biblical sense, represents the world and its vanities, lusts and corruptions.</font></font></p>
				 
				 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later and for other reasons, Alexander the Great introduced the custom of shaving to Europe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is reported that he compelled all the men in his army to shave their beards so that the enemies could not hold them down to slit their throats. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This custom was introduced into the Roman Empire by the great general Scipio Africanus in the third century BC. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It continued until the beginning of the second century AD, when Emperor Hadrian led the return to the use of beards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But Emperor Constantine reintroduced it, and by making himself "supreme pontiff" of the church in Rome and of the others he subjugated, the fashion caught on among the "Christianized" of his empire.</font></font></p>
				 
				 
				 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At different times in its history and depending on different circumstances, the Catholic Church authorized or prohibited the so-called facial hair ("barbae nutritio") of the clergy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The vast majority of the Roman or Latin Rite clergy shave their beards.</font></font></p>
				 
				 
				 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, how did the Catholic Church manage to eliminate this precept? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the International Encyclopedia and Dictionary, letter B, p. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1196/97 says: The first to shave his beard in the church was Pope Leo III, elected between the years 772 to 795 AD The clergy of the West followed the same example of Leo III. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
				 Here is the decree: The beard must be shave often, when we have to talk to people of respect. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We must show up with a shave on the same day. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">New Primer on Christian Doctrine p. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">286 - 6th paragraph.</font></font></p>
				 
				 
				  <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is observed that the Roman Catholic Church, through Leo III, threw down the precept of the beard, being followed by his followers, however, the Church of the East, did not approve this measure, there was a schism between the Church of the West and the Church of the East, in that period, being later mitigated the division, occurring another incident in the year 1054, where the definitive schism (division) between the Church of the East and the West took place.</font></font></p>
				 
				 
				 
				  <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is noteworthy that Catholic priests also often shave their beards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the Middle Ages, the beard signaled the separation that took place in the Christian Church with the realization of the Eastern Schism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many of the Catholic clergy were advised to shave their beards so they would not look like members of the Orthodox Church. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They have been doing so since 1054 AD to differentiate themselves from the Orthodox Church whose priests still sport their long beards to this day.</font></font></p>
				 
				 
				  <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the last days, the evangelical churches, daughters of Babylon follow the same teachings of their mother, drinking from the vine of her diabolic and deleterious doctrine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Criticizing and mocking God, his doctrine and his Church. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
				  However, the church of Christ, is persevering, does not trust in the teachings of men. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They hold fast to the dictates of Scripture which say, </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"But Peter and John answered them, Judge whether it is right with God to listen to you rather than to God" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Acts 4:19</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>
				 
				 				 
				  <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The church of Christ chooses rather to obey God and his holy doctrine, loving and obeying his Commandments, Statutes and Precepts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rejecting with all their strength the papal dogmas and secularism, AMEN.</font></font></p>
