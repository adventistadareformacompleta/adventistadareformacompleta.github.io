					<p align="justify"><span class="firstcharacter style12 style15"><span class="style16" style="color: #003366"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></span></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;" class="">The plight of professed servants of God is deplorable, contaminating themselves with icy and inanimate idols, represented by veiled pleasures, secularism, music disguised as hymns, use of makeup, use of jewelry, ornaments and deformation of clothing, to the detriment of love for precepts of God, mutilated by the fruits of the sinful nature, with an evident sign of the weakening of the Church emitted by the dark reception of the </font></font><a title="putrid" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;" class="">fetid</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;" class=""> apostasy, in flagrant contrast with the monastic and ascetic life of the Patristics who bravely defended the faith of the Church of the first centuries. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;" class="">As watchmen on the walls of Zion, ready to blow the trumpet at the first sign of danger, he urges Ministers, Pastors and Leaders to take courage and fulfill their duty of 
					</font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Cry with a loud voice, stop not, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Isaiah 58:1</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>

						
						 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This trumpet call has a certain sound, motivating the remnant Church to raise the bloody banner of our Lord Jesus Christ, with love, faith and obedience to his Commandments, Statutes and Precepts, cultivating the hope of keeping the sincere servants of God in the defense of faith, according to the sacred text revealed by the apostle who said: 
						  </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Beloved, seeking to write to you with all diligence concerning common salvation, I felt it necessary to write to you, and exhort you to strive for the faith that was once given to the saints" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jude 1:3-3</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>

	
						<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the tares grow together with the wheat, and sometimes they dim the brightness of the wheat by tarnishing sound Christian doctrine, when they should have been transformed into wheat to enlighten the world with the </font></font><a title="pure, virtuous" class="style5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unpolluted</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> teachings of Christ, unfortunately, there are not a few brothers and sisters who feel ashamed of the precepts that God has established as protective barriers to safeguard their church from idols and worldly contamination. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The need for the divine nature of Christ in the lives of these brothers is glimpsed, to be born again, loving the doctrine of Christ and feeling the pleasure in defending it by words and testimony as true wheat from Christ's granary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Turn to the Lord, and he will welcome you, since separation from God is death itself in life.</font></font></p>
						
						
						 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, it is worth remembering that the Day of the Lord is approaching and hastily knocks at our door, thus, the Holy Word of God once again demands from the direction of the Church: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Blow the trumpet in Zion and give a voice of rebuttal in my holy mountain ; let all the inhabitants of the earth be troubled, for the day of the LORD is coming, it is at hand; a day of darkness and thick darkness, a day of clouds and blackness!..." </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Joel 2:1-2</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The great day of the Lord's reckoning is approaching and it will be terrible, black for those who have scorned the tears that flowed from the sacred pages in the vain attempt to wash the hearts rotten by idolatry, in order to cleanse and purify them in the most holy indwelling of the Spirit of God, which, in fact, was refused.</font></font></p>
						
						 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is inferred, in these antitype days of atonement, that it is not wise to cherish idols, but to completely abandon earthly pleasures and all forms of idolatry, it is time to return to the Lord's arms with greater zeal, like Jacob, when God commanded him to dwell at Bethel and to erect an altar to sacrifice in his name, in fact, he not only complied with the divine command, but also ordered a profound reform in his family: 
						 </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"And Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments; let us arise, and let us go up to Bethel. God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and accompanied me in the way I went. Then they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that were in their hands, and the rings that hung in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak that was by the side. to Shechem" </font></font></span>

						<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Evangelical pseudo-evangelicals, obstinate by secular pleasures, and eager to promote idols, defend that makeup, fashions, adornments and use of jewelry were determined by God, point out texts that apparently reinforce the evil of the sinful nature that governs his will, from which they are slaves, in need of reprimand, as a useful remedy to rectify bad habits, in the hope of flourishing.</font></font></p>
						
						
						 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is urged to carefully examine and analyze the main texts used as ammunition to defend idols, however, in their legitimate context, we will start with a text carved in the book of the prophet Ezekiel, chapter 16 where Jerusalem is figuratively portrayed as a young woman adorned by God with jewels, ornaments, and embroidered garments, she is adorned as the bride of the Lord. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">See, in fact, what the Most High says, speaking allegorically of his union with his people Israel: 
						  </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"And I adorned your whole body with jewels, and I put bracelets on your arms and a rich necklace around your neck. a pendant in your nose, earrings in your ears, and I placed on your head a precious bridal crown.

						<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note the text account stating that God adorned it, roughly speaking, it is inferred that the interpretation seems to find shelter in these passages authorizing the church to use such adornments. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Defenders of idols claim that it was God himself who so profusely adorned the young woman portrayed in the text, therefore, modern churches are authorized to also use the adornments and idols listed in the passage written by Ezekiel. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 It is, therefore, a figurative account, which makes use of a didactic resource in vogue in those days: speaking to the people in their own language as Christ used several parables to illustrate to the people the greatness of his teachings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is a common practice in both Old and New Testament Scriptures to use allegories to represent divine teachings.</font></font></p>
						
						
						
						 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These verses portray Jerusalem (Israel) as an unwanted child, her ransom, and ultimately her as a harlot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the prophet Ezekiel is allegorically narrating the story of an unwanted child, his ransom, his marriage, and Israel's unfaithfulness as seen in verse 17: 
						  </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Even so have you taken your beautiful jewels of gold and silver, which I had given you, and you made images of men and fornicated with them" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ezeqiel 16:17</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the same vein are Sister White's teachings, where she portrays God's union with his people as a marriage, pointing to biblical texts to attest that the testimony is true.</font></font></p>

						<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, it has been proved without any trace of doubt that God did not authorize his people either yesterday or today to wear jewelry, fashions or any worldly idol, on the contrary in the text listed, you are rebuking your people to abstain from love for the world and their idols, for being an infidelity that breaks the Lord's covenant with his church.</font></font></p>
						
						<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second text under analysis is found in the book of Ezekiel, and it also contains an allegorical account, prefiguring the people of God as two women Aholah and Aolibá who desecrated the Sabbath, wearing eye paint, immersed in idolatry: 
						</font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"For when they had sacrificed their children to their idols, they came to my sanctuary the same day to desecrate it; and, behold, they did so in the midst of my house. a messenger, and, behold, they came. For their sake you washed, and colored your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments. And you sat on a bed of honor, before which was a table prepared; and you set my incense on it, my oil." With her the voice of a glad multitude was heard: with men of low order were drunkards brought from the wilderness, and they put bracelets on the women's hands, and crowns of splendor on their heads. shall they prostitute themselves to her, and she to them?" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ezekiel 23:38-43</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>
						
						
						<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As seen, the relationship between decorations, makeup and the use of jewelry with apostasy is evident in the Holy Bible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The text in question brings a symbolic account, the people of God appear as two women with allegorical names of Aholah, representing Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom, and Aholibah, representing Jerusalem, capital of the southern kingdom, who desecrated the Sabbath, idolized, called lovers and for them they painted their eyes and put ornaments; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the drunkards of the desert gave them bracelets and diadems, and they committed adultery.</font></font></p>
						
						
						<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The sisters were the "wives" of the Lord, that is, they had entered into an alliance with him and both fell in love with their lovers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oholah (Samaria) fell in love with the Assyrians, prostituting herself and defiling herself with their heathen idols. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Whereas, Oholibah (vs. 11-35). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It represents Judah, the southern kingdom, capital Jerusalem, which sealed alliances with Assyria and Babylon </font></font><span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(2Ki 20.12-18; 23.29, 2Ch 33.11; Is 39.1). </font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jerusalem, which should be faithful to the Lord, did not resist the charms of the Assyrians, nor of the Babylonians, nor of the Egyptians, and with them they all played the harlot.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
	Therefore, the second text pointed out as a vector of freedom for debauchery, authorizing Christians to use makeup, jewelry and adornments, cannot prosper, the context is the opposite of the way they intend to defend, in fact, the Lord uses the text to avoid contamination of his people with the heathen idols. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Faced with this context of apostasy, it is assumed that churches that despise the Law of the Lord, its Statutes and Precepts, and walk in the vanity of their thoughts, consequently transgressing the Sabbath, as the text emphasized, therefore, can perfectly use jewelry, makeup , fashions and other vanities worshiping beauty, if they do the most, break the law of God, with a patent violation of the eternal covenant with the Lord, they can at least use makeup, adornments and fashions.
</font></font></p>
						
						 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Furthermore, the Lord uses the pen of the prophet Isaiah against the arrogance, ornamentation, and wearing of jewels of the women of Zion, i.e., the rebuke is for her people, here figuratively rebuking and warning the kingdom of Judah and its capital Jerusalem: 
						 </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The Lord says: Because of the arrogance of the women of Zion, who walk with their heads held high, flirting with their eyes, parading with short strides, with ornaments clinking at their heels, the Lord will shave the heads of the women of Zion; the Lord will uncover their shame". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In that day the Lord will take away their ornaments: their bracelets, their headbands, and their necklaces; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">pendants, bracelets and veils, headdresses, ankle chains, belts, talismans and amulets; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the rings and nose ornaments; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the expensive clothes, the cloaks, the shawls, and the bags; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the mirrors, the linen clothes, the tiaras and the shawls. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead of perfume there will be a stench, instead of belts, rope instead of beautiful hairstyles, baldness instead of fine clothes, garments of mourning instead of beauty, scars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your men will fall by the edge of the sword; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">your warriors will die in combat. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zion's gates will mourn and mourn over it; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">and with nothing, she will sit on the ground"</font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Isaiah 3:16-26</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>
						
						<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the entirety of Isaiah chapter 3 is devoted to warning and rebuking the apostasy of Judah and Jerusalem, the southern kingdom, representing God's corrupt people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the prophet narrates the Lord taking away the ornaments and jewelry, he is symbolizing the removal of Israel's bond with the apostasy and contamination that they sucked out of the heathen nations and their idols. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And not authorizing the use of such adornments for their people as the pastors and leaders of the apostate churches pretend to believe and teach.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
It should be noted that the reproaches stigmatized in the prophecy of chapter 03 of Isaiah, was not relegated solely to the time of Israel, the same censure is imposed on the remaining church in these final days of apostasy, because they still remain with the same vigor as the first. reproof, seeing that the perils of the last days are upon us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As Sister White wrote, warning the church against latter-day apostasy and the impending doom that will befall churches that have loved outward appearance to the detriment of love for Christ and his doctrine:</font></font></p>

			<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hosea exercised his prophetic ministry at the end of a very prosperous period in Israel's history, just before the nation fell to the Assyrians in 722 BC. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By then, God's chosen people had stopped worshiping only the Lord, but also worshiped Baal, a Canaanite god. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the Lord God divulged that the origin of the trappings and adornments of his apostate people, was from his lover, baal a heathen idol: The "Pendants of Baal and their necklaces." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the Scriptures, for this reason, the Lord had divorced Israel on account of their constant adulteries, according to the lamentations of the prophet Jeremiah:</font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"And I saw that because of all this, because rebellious Israel had committed adultery, I sent her away, and gave her a bill of divorcement, which treacherous Judah her sister did not fear, but went away, and she also And it came to pass, because of the reputation of her fornication, that she defiled the land, because she committed adultery with stone and wood" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jeremiah 3:8-9</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>

						 </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The earth dries up and mourns, it perishes; the world withers and withers, the nobles of the earth are consumed.

						<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The breaking of the everlasting covenant is the reason for the apostasy and love for the use of makeup, jewelry, fashions, ornaments and adornments, these idols fostered by Satan, are occupying the Lord's place in the heart dominated by the sinful nature. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By solemn covenant the Lord offered to unite himself with his people, he alone should be worshiped, however, the professed people of God exchange him for jewelry, breaking the eternal covenant, bringing out all their infidelity and offering their love to idols and secular pleasures. . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is what represents the ornaments, rings and jewelry used allegorically by the prophet Hosea to severely rebuke Israel, who broke the covenant with the Lord and joined Satan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">See what Sister White wrote referring to the breaking of the Everlasting Covenant:</font></font></p>
						
						
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Lord united His people to Himself by a solemn covenant, promising them to be their God, while the people pledged themselves to be His alone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Said the Lord, "And I will betroth thee to me for ever: I will betroth thee to me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in kindness, and in mercies." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hosea 2:19. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
The church's unfaithfulness to Christ, allowing its trust and affection to stray from Him, and allowing the love of worldly things to occupy the soul, is compared with the violation of the marriage vow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The sin of Israel, departing from the Lord, is presented under this figure; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">and the wonderful love of God, which they thus despise, is touchingly described. </font></font><br>

						<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyway, once again, it is the repetition of the same contexts, the passages presented in no way authorize the church of God to break the alliance with him and delight in the arms of apostasy, adopting the use of makeup, fashions, jewelry and ornaments. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The adornment of the church of God is umbilically inherent in Christ and his promise to lend us his divine nature, that we may walk copiously in loving sound doctrine and obeying, without reservation, all the Commandments, Statutes and Precepts of the Lord.</font></font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The delight of Christians was communion with their Savior, the Christian community was assiduously dedicated to prayers, meditation, study of the Scriptures and fasting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The leaders of the fledgling Christian church taught the members monasticism and to renounce these pernicious pleasures, so common in the pagan world, as we can see in the wise teachings of Tertullian about adornments, ornaments, cosmetics and colorful clothes.</font></font></p>

                 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Polycarp of Smyrna, was a disciple of the Apostle John and preserved the apostolic customs in the Christian community, at the opportune moment we will study the controversy that erupted in the primitive church, on account of the date of Easter, Polycarp celebrated the Holy Supper on the fourth date, the same date that the apostle John celebrated, that is, on the 14th of Abib of the Jewish calendar, while the bishop of Rome, Victor II, defended the date of the first Sunday after that date, claiming that Jesus was resurrected on that day. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like Polycarp, Clement fought for the faith that was given to the saints and vehemently exhorted the good customs that Christians should adopt in the church and outside it, including exhorting women to pray with a veil, as can be seen in his writings:</font></font></p>


<blockquote>

Let the woman, moreover, observe this: she always wears a veil, except when she is at home, for her figure must be respectable and inaccessible to the eyes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With shame and veil before her eyes she will never go astray, nor will she incite another to fall into sin, by baring her face. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Yes, this is the will of the logos (Jesus): it is very convenient for you to pray covered. </font></font><br>

   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Resistance to the sacred teachings of the women of Clement's time are the same as they are today: that God did not forbid using the devil's bait, which has nothing to do with it, that it is legalism or extremism, however, adopting the evil seed of idolatrous symbols of the devil in the apostate churches, even suffering severe reproof from the church of Christ, have not changed, the serpent continues to bite the church with apostasy and the church of Christ resisting sin by trampling the devil's head, according to the word of God coined in Genesis 3:15. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Next, Clement exudes concern with women contaminated by idols, he warns of the use of makeup and colorful clothes, as seen in his writings:</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What good can we expect from the conduct of these superbly dressed women, who wear themselves and adorn themselves with flowers? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Never flaunt your dress, nor quarrel on your honorable day, declares the sage. </font></font><br>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like the law promulgated by Moses, leprosy is an object of rejection, something unclean, as are the variety of colors and colorful garments, because of their resemblance to the scales of various shades of a serpent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without going any further, he considers what is not adorned with many colors to be pure... </font></font><br>

   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the Church Fathers, the use of refined, expensive perfumes was a waste, given that the members of the early Christian church used all their few resources, in the midst of constant persecution, to meet the needy, it was a church that took serious obedience to the Doctrine, prayer, the breaking of bread and communion according to the text carved in Acts 2:42. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For this reason, Clement defended the expulsion of the apothecaries, who sold refined perfumes, since the Christians used ointments as perfumes, more practical and cheaper, and of the inkwells that sold fabrics with bright colors:</font></font></p>			
						
		

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I approve of the conduct of those who, exasperated by the consequences of this foolish obstinacy to perfume themselves, banished apothecaries from well-governed cities; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">for perfumes corrupt good manners and make men effeminate; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">these laws also apply to dyers who dye fabrics too brightly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is a crime to admit these refined perfumes and these counterfeit fabrics into cities that profess to love the truth. </font></font><br>

<blockquote>

	In addition, there is still a class of brothers who are disgusted with the exhortations, reprimands and exclusion of the believer from the church because of the use of ornaments, fashions, paintings, jewelry and other idols, for them they are small things, they claim they have problems more serious to be solved, therefore the direction of the Church should only work with the big problems and not give so much emphasis to these trivial, unimportant things. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the outer adornments are really unimportant, why do the sisters continue to wear them? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why do they despise the prohibitions of the Word of God in the defense of these idols, since it is of no importance to them? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why exchange the love of Christ, if any, for jewelry? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sister White reveals the reason for such attachment to outward adornment, lack of inward adornment, divine nature that of Christ:</font></font></p>

                 </p>
						
 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the true adornment of a sincere and devout Christian, Jesus Christ, the nourishment of his divine nature in our hearts is the great wealth and adornment of the Christian, it produces a frugal life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Patristic Church adorned itself with monasticism, what is monasticism, what does it mean? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was the way of life of early Christians, they spiritually moved away from the cares of the world, to dedicate themselves exclusively to God, some lived in caves in the desert, like John the Baptist, or in reserved places in their homes, like Jerome and Augustine did. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was practiced individually or in community, they adorned themselves by studying the Scriptures, praying for a vast amount of time, meditating and fasting frequently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not only that, in addition to worship, prayer, study and Christian service, the monastic life required asceticism,</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
An example of ancient monastic manifestation practiced in the Apostolic church is glimpsed in I Timothy 5, where Paul coined the lives of widows over 60 who lived together, in verse 11, dedicated exclusively to prayer and good works, verse 5. Rejecting the young widows for not bearing the cloister, verse 11, which is why the Apostle advises young Christian widows to marry and bring up their children in the Lord, verse 14.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
In view of the above, we are fully convinced of inferring that the Christian who feeds his spirit on the divine nature of Christ, who is dedicated to asceticism, his heart has no room for external adornments, he has no pleasure in secular idols, will never shorten his clothes. or they will adorn themselves with jewelry, rings, makeup, paintings, or anything that is condemned by the Word of God. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Resistance, rebelliousness and insubmission to the true teachings of the Word of God, which hinders the external adornment, are difficult for many, or even impossible to abandon them, due to the food of the sinful nature, lack of consecration and conversion, the frank rejection of the divine nature of Christ and obedience to his Word excludes such brothers from the Plan of salvation, becoming an instrument of scandal for the church and the world, </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">that's why they don't feel ashamed to post nude pictures on the internet for the world to see, because they take pleasure in the admiration and applause of the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jesus said: where your treasure is, there your heart is.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 
Sometimes we have to admit and place the sole and exclusive blame on the parents for the downfall of their children. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the children are still infants, Christian parents are ashamed to dress them in the appropriate clothes, according to the Scriptures, they buy or make worldly clothes, when the child grows up he does not want to wear the clothes symbol of the divine nature of Christ, the parents want to force him, they do not imagine that it was they who cultivated the seed of rebellion, the young man's heart is infected by secular pleasures, his parents did not adorn him for Christ, but for the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sister White warns Christian parents to teach their children modesty from an early age, adorning them for Christ, as can be seen: 
</font></font></p>


<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Soon (the parent) can lead them to understand that God wants their children to be adorned, not with artificial externals, but with the beauty of character, the graces of goodness and affection, which will make their hearts exult with joy and happiness. </font></font><br>

   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Regarding the matter of raising children for the Lord, it is urged to mention, that John Wesley's grandmother conceived 25 children, the twenty-fourth was called Susana, married Samuel Wesley, John Wesley was the fifteenth of the offspring of 19 children generated by the couple. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">See, in fact, how Susana raised her 19 children:</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Susan Wesley believed that 'he that spares the rod hateth his son' (Prov. 13:24), and would not allow her children to cry aloud. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, although the house was full of children, there were never sad times or turmoil in the home. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A son never gained anything by crying at Susana Wesley </font></font><br>

   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Parents who despise this teaching, and indulge the sinful desires of their children, will pay the price of being weighed in the balance and found wanting, with God and with their children. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hence, no parent should encourage the love of their children by external adornments, as White wrote:</font></font></p>

		 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We cannot forget that Christian witness is an integral part of the spiritual life, which begins in childhood, so any appearance of evil that causes scandal must be reprimanded, whether in children, young people, adults or the elderly. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
As we have seen and studied exhaustively, in the Old and New Testaments, passing through the Patristic Church, Adventist Pioneers and the Remnant Church, throughout this journey we did not find any space for idol worship, on the contrary, we saw that the Lord strictly forbids the use of gold, jewels, ornaments, in short, any external adornment, just pay attention to the exhortation of the Apostle Peter:
 </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Let them not be adorned on the outside, in the curling of the hair, in the wearing of gold jewelry, in the composure of dresses" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I Peter 3 :3</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, the divine Nature of Christ, this is the true adornment of the devout Christian. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, some brothers and sisters claim that married women can use a gold ring to prove the marriage bond, preventing possible harassment by third parties who are unaware of their true marital status. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth asking: Is your marriage vow based on a piece of metal or on Christ? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you answer in Christ, then forsake the idol of the brass ring and trust in the covenant made with the approval of Christ, if, however, you answer in the brass ring, then wear the ring and forsake Christ, we cannot serve two Sirs, either you serve the Sovereign of the Universe or baal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Which will you choose?</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
 	The brother or sister who chooses to wear a wedding ring, to the detriment of the Scriptures, according to the exhortation of the prophet Jeremiah, has forgotten his God. </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Has the maiden forgotten her ornaments, or the bride forgotten her girdle? Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jeremiah 2:32</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And surely he chose Baal, therefore the Lord says, </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I will punish her for the days of the Baals, in which she burned incense to them, and decked herself with her earrings and with her jewels, and went after her lovers, but has forgotten me, says the Lord" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hosea 2:13</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whoever sustains their marriage with a bond in a metal alliance, in fact, is united by metal and not in the marriage bond of a spirit clothed with the nature of Christ, with support in respect, friendship and companionship. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Satan just wants to open a door with the use of the wedding ring to flood the church with external adornments, if the direction of the church is flexible, and allow the believer to wear the wedding ring, a door is open, what is the difference of the wedding ring? wedding to any other type of jewelry? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">None. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sister White faced the same situation in her day, and said that the Christian is not unfaithful to need a gold ring to prove his fidelity, rightly she condemned the use of a wedding ring pointing with a dangerous leaven, as we can see in her writings:</font></font></p>
		
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some have been preoccupied with the use of wedding rings, feeling that the wives of our ministers must conform to this custom. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do not need to wear this ring, for we are not unfaithful to our marriage vow, and the wearing of the ring will not be proof of our faithfulness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I deeply feel this fermentation process that seems to be going on among us, in accordance with custom and fashion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No bucks are to be spent on this golden rim to testify that we are married. </font></font><br>

</blockquote>
       
   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Further on, she invokes Paul's teachings to justify as inappropriate for the believer to wear any kind of jewelry, signaling the danger of departing from the legitimate teachings of the Bible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is one thus says the Lord:</font></font></p>
       
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Apostle gave very explicit directions on this point; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I therefore want women to dress themselves in honest attire, with modesty and modesty, not with braids, or with gold, or pearls, or precious garments, but as befits women who make a profession of serving God with good works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(II Timothy 2:8-10). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here the Lord, through his apostle, expressly speaks against the use of gold. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let those who have had experience take care not to cause others to swerve on this point because of their example. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That ring which surrounds your finger is perhaps very simple, but it is useless, and its use has a wrong influence on others. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">
“Especially the wives of our ministers should be careful not to depart from the clear teachings of the Bible. </font></font><br>

	   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In any case, it was not in vain that God favored his people with precepts, they have a purpose, to protect the church from corruption and the fashions of the world, they are protective barriers to safeguard the church, distinguishing between the church and the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Lord knows the sinful nature that we possess, we are inclined to follow it, knowing said, Satan attacks this precious moral precept by defiling it with impudent fashions and embellishments, intending to turn God's people away from due obedience, because he knows the symbology that represents the precept of dress, the divine nature of Christ. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth reiterating that the Bible forbids ostentation in clothing, bright colors and selflessness in the use of jewelry or anything that draws attention to you and not to Christ, as seen:</font></font></p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am often asked the question whether I believe it is wrong to wear simple linen collars. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">

   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What he wanted to convey with his answer was exactly what the devil always does, sharpen our vanity, receive the laurels for the sermon, the beauty of the dress ornament, the jewelry that adorns the body or the costume, in short, the devil wants us get excited to feed the thought that we're capable, we don't need Christ, and that's a fatal mistake. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the same vein are the true teachings of Sister White, who said:</font></font></p>

   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When God is truly loved, there is no regret in sacrifice, all abstinence is praiseworthy and done with pleasure, removing unnecessary embellishments, tufts, and fashions from clothing is a duty, the wearing of modest dress is inherent in the believer, he leaves the adornments because his heart is nourished by Christ, he is ashamed to wear external adornments that do not agree with his profession of faith nor with the doctrine of Christ, therefore:</font></font></p>

	  <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The persistence in using the aforementioned idols is a strong proof of those who do not love God, but themselves, satisfying the sinful nature and, indeed, are closing the door of salvation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the greatest sin is to close the door to people from the world and from other churches, with the scandals promoted, how can we win someone, or call him to the true Church of Christ, if we ourselves are ashamed of the Sound Doctrine? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It behooves Sister White, in this sad and bizarre situation, to exhort weak-minded, vain-hearted Christians:</font></font></p>

		 
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dear young people, your disposition to dress according to the fashion, using gold and artificial things to satisfy vanity, does not recommend to others the religion or the truth that you profess. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Discreet people will consider your desire to adorn yourself as proof that you have a weak mind and a vain heart. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The simple, unpretentious dress will be a recommendation for my young sisters. </font></font><br>
