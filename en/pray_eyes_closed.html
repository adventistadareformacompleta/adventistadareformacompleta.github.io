				 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;" class="">The divine nature of Christ, is food for the Christian and prayer together with meditation are ways of receiving this nourishment, until we become friends with Christ, after all, prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend (Questions I would ask Sister White, 143), therefore, we need to pray and recognize our dependence on the Creator, praying with a clean heart, reverence and posture, as the Scriptures taught us on our knees, hands raised and eyes closed, or we will languish in a starving state until we die. of spiritual inedia. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not forgetting that in the midst of machines, on the street, and on trips, we can lift our hearts to God in supplications that will be heard, but, in church, in private prayers, in the bedroom or in family worship, we need to fulfill the divine dictates, just as Moses showed us when he faced Amalek,</font></font></p>
				 
				 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are people eager to find enlightenment, to discover duties to fulfill that he alone is able to obey, with the aim of being the only one who knows the truth who communes with God, however, they are without Christ, they know nothing about the divine nature that enables us to love and obey the truth, reconciling ourselves with God. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many of these brethren are zealous, Satan knows they are uncovered, without the divine nature of Christ to protect them, takes advantage to direct them through crooked paths of the sinful nature, see what Sister White says:</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some zealous members who aim at originality and are using all their energy to achieve it, have made a serious mistake in seeking to achieve something sensational, wonderful, fascinating before the people, something they think others do not understand; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">but they themselves do not know what they are talking about. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They speculate with the word of God, putting forward ideas that are not a hint of help for themselves or the church. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the moment they may excite the imagination, but there is a reaction, and these very ideas become an obstacle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Faith is confused with fancy, and its views can incline the mind in a wrong direction. </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ellen G. White, Selected Messages Vol I, page 180</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>
   
   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They are meticulous in the performance of religious duties, meeting the insatiable desires of the sinful nature, fulfilling the words of Christ: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, This people honors me with their lips, but with their hearts. far from me. It is in vain that they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Matthew 15:7-9</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Though covered with duties to fulfil, as were the Jews, hearts are still far from God, because they are whitewashed graves, the blind leading the blind, there is sight, that without the righteousness of Christ, every sacrifice directed to God is offered for self-righteousness, and the fruits of original sin (sinful nature) remain separate from God:</font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"But your iniquities have separated between you and your God; and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Isaiah 59:2</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even Moses could not see the face of God, he would die, because the Lord does not support the sinful nature, that is, original sin itself, conceived by Lucifer when he rebelled in heaven, is something that is within man, only Jesus, through of the atoning work can remove the sinful nature, lending its divine nature, reconciling man to God, therefore, everything we offer to God has to rise with the incense of the divine nature of Christ to be accepted by the Creator.</font></font></p> 
   
   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Brethren who are not nourished by the divine nature of Christ, are in great danger, are prone to panning for lights to illuminate the church, according to their own judgment, resulting in discord, resentment, separation, and death. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They interpret texts from the Bible and the Testimonies out of context, they are entrenched in their understandings and they don't care how many people are going to kill in the church. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Christ warned, </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"the hour is coming, when everyone who kills you will think he is doing God a service" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">John 16:2</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Death is not always literal, many brothers, entire families, can die spiritually in the church due to reckless attitudes, doctrinal points detached from their contexts and the poison of the tongue. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the same vein are the teachings of Sister White, verbis:</font></font></p> 
   

   <blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are some who take from the word of God and also from the testimonies highlighted paragraphs or sentences that can be interpreted so as to fit their ideas, and they stop at them, and cast themselves in their own positions, when God is not leading them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is your danger. </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ellen G. White, Selected Messages Vol I, page 179</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even knowing the truth, if our religious life is not nourished by the divine nature of Christ, in order to obey these truths out of love, our religious life is useless, everything is relegated to formalism, the appearance of an exemplary religious life, when in fact we do not of whitewashed graves in the eyes of God. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the reason why many brothers, even knowing the truth, embark on paths of the fire of fanaticism or the ice of indifference.</font></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Regrettably, these religious confusions often happen within the church, in the subject under discussion, there are not a few religious people supporting the thesis that prayer should be done in church, in private and domestic services with eyes open, for this they list some biblical texts as the foundation of their theses, let's go to them.</font></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those who advocate this cause claim that the model, Jesus, prayed with his eyes open, based on two texts narrated by the apostle John. </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Then they took away the stone.

<p align="justify"> <span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"When Jesus had spoken these things, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">John 17:1</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">and </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I lift up my eyes to you who dwell in heaven!

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first text occurred in the episode in which Jesus raises Lazarus, while in the second text, Jesus was on the verge of sealing the first stage of the plan of Redemption, dying on the cross. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Analyzing the texts closely, it is clear that there is no THUS SAITH THE LORD, no command for the disciples or their church to pray with their eyes open. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is an extensive interpretation and an assumption, lifting your eyes is not a command to pray with your eyes open, although advocates of the infamous doctrine of praying with your eyes open maintain that it is, based on the following texts: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I lift up my eyes to the mountains; where will my help come from?" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Psalms 121:1</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p> 

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note that the expression lift up your eyes is not a command to pray with your eyes open. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The expression “our eyes are fixed on the Lord” means that our understanding, our concentration must be fixed on the Creator. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In another text (seen elsewhere) the Lord commands to lift up the heart to the Lord, with the same context as the previous text see: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Let us lift up our hearts together with our hands to God in heaven"</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Lamentations 3:1 </font></font><span class="style1"> </span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How can we lift our hearts to God in heaven? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Indeed, the apostle Paul helps us to unravel the issue when he says: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The eyes of your hearts being enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ephesians 1:18</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">See Paul refers to illuminating the eyes of the heart, of course it's a metaphor, he's referring to giving knowledge, understanding, when the Bible speaks of lifting the eyes or the heart, the context is raising understanding, discernment, knowledge , see the following text when Daniel speaks of lifting up one's eyes to heaven as understanding coming or attaining knowledge: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"But at the end of those days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and understanding came again to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and glorified him who lives forever, whose dominion is everlasting, and whose kingdom is from generation to generation" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Daniel 4:34</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p> 



<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jesus himself, who says to pray with eyes open, teaches us to pray with eyes closed, according to the Scriptures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jesus prayed prostrate on his face, therefore, he did not have his eyes fixed on heaven, much less open, as proof that he did not authorize his disciples to pray with their eyes open, verbis, the text: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Advancing a little, fell on his face, praying and saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me!

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At another time, after the resurrection, Jesus appears to his disciples who did not recognize him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An event that took place when they were on their way to Emmaus, they were talking about the latest events, and when they were talking Jesus himself approached and went with them. </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"His eyes were, as it were, prevented from recognizing him" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Luke 24:16</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They knew that Jesus was dead, they forgot the words when he said that he would rise again, for this reason his eyes were closed so as not to recognize him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Standing in the midst of the disciples, Jesus blessed the bread. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only after asking for the blessings for the bread, did they open their eyes and recognize him, because they saw the mark of the nails in his hands, as proof that they asked for the blessings for the bread with their eyes closed.</font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"And it came to pass, as they were at table, as he took bread, I blessed it, and when he had broken it, he gave it to them; then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; but he disappeared from their presence" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Luke 24: 30-31</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When Jesus asked for the blessing for the bread, the disciples had their eyes closed, after the blessings, they opened their eyes and only recognized him because Jesus stretched out his hands to distribute the bread and not because he opened their understanding, they saw the marks of the nails recognizing that was the Master, according to White's teaching in the following terms:</font></font></p> 

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The simple evening meal, consisting of bread, is readily prepared. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is placed before the Guest, who has taken his seat at the head of the table. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He then stretches out his hands to bless the food. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The disciples recoil in astonishment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your Companion extends his hands in exactly the same way as the Master. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They look again, and behold, they see the marks of the nails in his hands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Both immediately exclaim: It is the Lord! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He rose from the dead. </font></font><br>

</blockquote>
   
   
<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Notice that the disciples look again, that is, they look twice to notice the nail marks and recognize their Master. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, defenders of the doctrine of praying with eyes open, teach that the eyes of the disciples were closed when Jesus asked for blessings for the bread and opened after the blessing, because it is symbolic, it was a lack of understanding. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Who opened their eyes because they received understanding and recognized Jesus.</font></font></p>





<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Examining the Scriptures, it is clear that Jesus only begins to teach the Scriptures to the disciples after being recognized by them when they saw the marks on his hands, so he began to teach everything that was written about him, which was fulfilled according to Moses, the Psalms and the Prophets, verbis: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Then Jesus said to them, These are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you; everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, in the Prophets and in the Psalms" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Luke 24:43</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then he opened their eyes of understanding to understand the Scriptures about Christ and his work and not to recognize Jesus. </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Luke 24:45</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It remains proven that the disciples were literally with their eyes closed when Jesus asked for the blessings for the bread, after opening their eyes they only recognized him when they saw the marks on their hands.</font></font></p> 

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another text used to support the doctrine of praying with open eyes is carved in the book of Peter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They claim that Peter was praying with his eyes open, about the sixth hour, or noon, indeed it is time for the church of God to pray, let's examine the text: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The next day, as they were going on their way, and being near the city, Peter on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray. He was hungry and wanted to eat, but while food was being prepared for him, an ecstasy came over him, and he saw heaven open and an object descending as if it were a great sheet, which was lowered to the earth by its four corners" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Acts 10:9-11</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p> 

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What can be inferred from the text is that Peter was praying, it does not say whether his eyes were open or closed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the midst of prayer he was seized by the Spirit of God in vision, then he saw heaven opened, and a great sheet with quadrupeds and birds, signifying that God had granted opportunity to the Gentiles, that the Jews would no longer be his peculiar people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The text does not say that Peter was praying with his eyes open, but that he saw heaven open because he was in vision, let's see Sister White's teachings:</font></font></p>


<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Immediately after this interview with Cornelius the angel came to Peter, who, weakened and hungry from the journey, was praying on the terrace of his house. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As he was praying, a vision was shown to him, and he saw heaven being opened and an object coming down like a great sheet, which was lowered to the earth by its four corners, containing all kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles of the earth, and birds of the air. . </font></font><br>

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They also assert that Stephen was looking to heaven when he prayed in his last moments, therefore he was praying with his eyes open. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let us examine the aforementioned text: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"But Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked up into heaven, and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on his right hand, and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man, standing at the right hand of God" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Acts 7:55-56</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p> 

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stephen, who was in the Sanhedrin speaking to the priests at the time of his judgment, when he established connection between Christ and the prophecies, and spoke vehemently against the priests, saying, 'You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Spirit. Holy, just as your fathers did. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They were furious and rushed at Stephen in fury. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Knowing Estevão that he was going to die, he had this vision, which is said to be praying with his eyes open at the moment of death. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note that Stephen sees heaven opened in vision just before the stoning, according to Sister White, verbis:</font></font></p>


<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The scene around him was lost to him; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the portals of heaven were opened, and Stephen, looking, saw the glory of the courts of God, and Christ, as if he had just risen from his throne, ready to sustain his servant, who was about to suffer martyrdom for his name. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When Stephen described the glorious scenes unfolded before him, it was more than his persecutors could sweat. </font></font><br>

</blockquote>
   
   
   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note the text of sister white teaching, that Stephen was describing the wonderful scenes that his eyes beheld, so he was not praying with his eyes open, who prays is not narrating facts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Furthermore, kneeling prayer takes place after the vision ends, and at that time Scripture does not say that Stephen was praying with his eyes open. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the enraged priests sentenced him to death summarily, without even concluding the trial with a sentence. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read the text: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Then, kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin against them!

   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, the text that refers to Balaam, where they argue that Balaam was praying with his eyes open, let's go to the text: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"When Balaam lifted up his eyes, and saw Israel encamped according to their tribes, the Spirit of God came upon him. And he said, The word of Balaam the son of Beor, the word of a man with open eyes, the word of him who hears the sayings of God, who sees the sight of the Almighty, and falls down with open eyes" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Numbers 24:2 -4</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is observed in this text is that Balaam is in vision, he looks at Israel encamped with the intention of cursing the chosen of the Lord, then, the Spirit of God came upon him and blessed the people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Lord at that time had already departed from Balaam on account of his idolatry in earning a profit offered by Balak, Balaam was backslidden. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What does the Lord want to teach when he says prostrate yourself with your eyes open? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is it an order to pray with eyes open? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it was a command, it was for the backsliders, because at that time the Lord had already rejected Balaam because of his apostasy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">God considered him his adversary, because the way of Balaam was wicked before the Lord, read the text:</font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Then the Lord opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand; wherefore he bowed his head and fell on his face to the ground.

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is hard to imagine God commanding prayer with open eyes, instituting a doctrine through an apostate man. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, when God says man with his eyes open, again, he is referring to the knowledge, science, understanding of the Most High, which Balaam lacked at that time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read the following text to sediment this assertion: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"The word of him that hears the sayings of God and knows the knowledge of the Most High; of him that sees the vision of the Almighty, and falls down, but with open eyes" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Numbers 24:16</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When He says, prostrate yourself with open eyes, he is not talking about literally opening your eyes, the context is prostrating yourself with understanding, with the knowledge of the Most High. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He was blinded by understanding.</font></font></p> 

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is opportune to point out that, if we take the Biblical texts literally, we are going to get complicated with the Scriptures which says: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Who enabled us to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the spirit; for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">II Corinthians 3:6</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we analyze other Biblical texts, contrary to the texts already analyzed, to the letter, we will conclude that God forbids us to raise our eyes to heaven or even to the Creator. </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Take heed that you do not lift up your eyes to the heavens, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, that is, all the host of heaven, be tempted to bow down to them and serve those things which the Lord your God, has repeated it to all people under all the heavens" </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deuteronomy 4:19</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p> 

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In another passage, Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God. </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"And he said, I am the God of thy Father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What to say about the Pharisee and the publican, perhaps the Pharisee was praying with his eyes open, exalted, while the publican humbly prayed with his eyes closed because he did not raise his eyes to heaven, he asked the Lord for mercy, in the following terms: </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">" The pubican, standing afar off, dared not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, O God, be merciful to me, a sinner! </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Luke 18:13</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></p>

   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth noting, that Satan tried to divert the minds of the leaders of the early church to non-essential points, of no importance for the spiritual growth of the church, he tried the great deceiver, to cause doubts and disharmony by dividing the direction of the church, fomenting discord and disputes of points between siblings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Satan was defeated, his onslaught was not successful, given that the disciples and martyrs who took over the direction of the church had the greatest weapon against Satan's attack and against fanaticism, assumption and comparisons disguised as holiness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They possessed the divine nature of Christ in their hearts, therefore, they were protected from deception, sophistry, and doctrinal error. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The church of Ephesus, or white horse, was the church purer in matters of doctrine than any that followed it, yet,</font></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Sister White's time, however, many doctrinal controversies arose, some brothers driven by the sinful nature, tried to succeed in the process of sanctification, trying to purify themselves by human effort, obeying doctrinal points according to their own judgments, trying the impossible, to achieve sanctification. and the obedience of the law by human effort, divorced from the divine nature of Christ, which waters hearts with the love necessary to obey the law and the precepts of God. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So these brethren, driven by fanaticism, listed several unimportant doctrinal texts, for Sister White to judge whether they were right or wrong, among the points listed was the doctrine of praying with open eyes, according to the inspired text of the prophetess White:</font></font></p>

<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In times past, many non-essential, fanciful theories have been presented to me for my judgment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some defend the theory that believers should pray with their eyes open. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Others teach that, as those who formerly ministered in the sacred office were required, on entering the sanctuary, to take off their sandals and wash their feet, believers today should take off their shoes when entering the house of worship. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Still others refer to the sixth commandment, and declare that even the insects that torment human creatures must not be killed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And some have advanced the theory that the redeemed will not have gray hair—as if that were a matter of any importance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am instructed to say that these theories are the product of spirits ignorant of the first principles of the gospel. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Through the same,</font></font><br>

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Satan's aim is clear, when he raises brothers contaminated by fanaticism, destitute of the divine nature of Christ, with doctrinal points of no importance, he intends to sow discord, separation and scandal in the bosom of the church by diverting the servants of God from the great throbbing themes. and necessary to rescue souls from its grasp and consequently prepare the church to receive the righteousness of Christ, which will culminate in the receiving of the Latter Rain and assisting the third angel in the final message of warning to a doomed world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to text extracted from White's writings, the danger was not relegated to the past. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Satan is investing in the last days with greater vigor to lead the minds of God's servants into wrong directions and destroy them:</font></font></p>


<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The ministers of Christ today are in the same danger. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Satan is continually at work to lead their minds into wrong directions, so that the truth loses its hold on the heart. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And unless ministers and people observe the truth and are sanctified by it, they will allow matters of no vital importance to occupy their minds. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This will lead to sophistry and disputes; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">for innumerable points of contention will arise. </font></font><br>

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is written that in the last days Satan will raise many fanciful theories, using people to support doctrines supported by texts removed from their true context. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Comparisons, assumptions and presumption would be the pillar, however, it is vitally important that we sustain the doctrine of Christ embodied in ONE THUS SAITH THE LORD, according to Sister White's teachings where she says:</font></font></p>

<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But God will have on earth a people who will keep the Bible, and the Bible alone, as the norm of all doctrines and the basis of all reforms....

<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As seen elsewhere, the doctrine of praying with open eyes was aroused in Sister White's time for her to exercise her judgment and render the verdict, where she was instructed by the Lord to say that this matter and others of lesser importance are the fruit of ignorant spirits. of eternal truths, that we must devote our energies to themes related to the righteousness of Christ, obey the doctrine out of love using the tools that result in union and communion in the church, among the brothers and with God. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Satan wants to divert the church's attention to directions that seem right to man, but in the end is death, </font></font><span class="porche-footer"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"There is a way that seems right to man, but the end is the ways of death </font></font></span> <span class="style1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Proverbs 14:12</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The enemy of souls, feeds self-righteousness with the sanctification of human effort, destitute of Christ, sowing doubts, discord, apostasy, divisions and spiritual death. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note that false lights always result in confusion, enmity in the church and a spirit of rebellion of self-righteousness, it never promotes peace, knowing how to dialogue, listening to the brother, patience and resolving the weather with prayer, fasting and Christian spirit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the last days, these that we are going through, Satan brings out the same doctrine that was pacified in the time of the pioneers, see the statement of one of the staunch defenders of open-eyed prayer, he said that: "Prayer with closed eyes comes from the spiritism that slowly infiltrated the religious world.

   <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For our safety, we must compare texts and hold to THUS SAITH THE LORD, an exact, unquestionable order and avoid lights leveraged by assumptions and comparisons disguised as holiness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Brothers who do not take questions that they understand to be lights, for the judgment of other more experienced brothers, are at great risk of being trampled by Satan in the name of justice, zeal and holiness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They usually support their theses by faults they think they find in the church or in the lives of some brothers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Watch out! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Satan has deep knowledge and unless they are supported by the righteousness of Christ, they will be easy targets used by the enemy as an instrument. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is time to divest ourselves of our vanities and with humility learn to dialogue about the points that generate doubts in order to learn from Christ and harmonize the church with the protective shield of the divine nature. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sister White says:</font></font></p>
