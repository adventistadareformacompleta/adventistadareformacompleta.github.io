					<p align="justify">It is opportune to point out that the precept of clothing is one of the most contested doctrines among the religious, given that it implies a cross, and one can only carry this cross and others that exist in Christian doctrine, which indeed, has a divine nature. </font><font class="" style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is the duty of the Church of God to teach the members the standard of dress, simple clothing suited to the requirements of Christ, completely devoid of any ornament, gaudy colors, or anything else that would call attention to self and not to Christ. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The burden of teaching dress code is not only the Pastor's but also the teacher's, see White's text which says:</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No education can be complete which does not teach correct principles in regard to dress. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without such teaching, the work of education is often retarded and perverted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Love of dress and devotion to fashion are among the most formidable opponents and decided embarrassments there is to the teacher. </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ellen G. White, Child Guidance, 1988, page 419 / Education, page 246</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>

				 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The purpose of doctrinal teaching and Christian education is to prepare the church to receive the righteousness of Christ, the symbol of which is dress, which is why Sister White directly asks the sisters of the church:</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My sisters, your dress is either speaking for Christ and sacred truth, or for the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Which will be? </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ellen G. White, Child Guidance, 1988, pg 420 / Testimonies for the Church 4, pg 641 / Testimonies Select 1, pg 596</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>
				 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;" class="">The most adequate answer is, it depends on the nature that feeds you, if by chance you choose to cherish the sinful nature, in fact, your dress and your religious life will testify in favor of the world, with its fashions, ornaments, idols and rejection of clothing. appropriate, on the other hand:</font></font></p>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those who are engaged in this work will not be satisfied with the fashions and follies that absorb the minds and affections of women in these last days. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If they are really children of God, they will be partakers of the divine nature. </font></font><br> 
<span class="style8"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church 3, page 483 / Child Guidance, 1988, page 436 / Testimonies 1, page 411</font></font></span></div>
</blockquote>

					<p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The daughters of God will certainly choose to participate in the divine nature, whose fruits, the world abhors its fashions and secularism, will not be ashamed to wear the clothing that speaks in favor of Christ, symbol of his divine nature, with love and joy, rejecting from the bottom of the heart everything that is not in accordance with the will of God.</font></font></p>
		
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Speak of Christ, and when the heart is converted, everything that is not in harmony with the Word of God will be banished. </font></font><br>

</blockquote>
		
		 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Bible is our Constitution in matters of faith, therefore, all doctrinal norms are compelled to pass through this sieve, clothing is a moral precept, it symbolizes the divine nature of Christ that will be clothed in the penitent believer, returning to the state of Adam before of sin, thus.</font></font></p>
		 
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All matters of dress must be strictly observed, closely following the biblical rule. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fashion has been the goddess that rules the outside world, and it often infiltrates the church. </font></font><br>

</blockquote>		 
		 
		 <p align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just as Satan used Balaam to encourage the Hebrews to defile themselves with Moabite women at Baal Peor, for the purpose of driving God away from the camp and the Hebrews becoming easy prey; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this cunning deceiver, spares no effort to defile the symbol of the divine nature of Christ, clothing, with fashions, adornments and idols, with the same purpose of driving the Lord away from the midst of his people, who offered him a defective sacrifice contaminated by justice. own, relegating this precept to mere formalism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even with all the efforts of the Church of God in maintaining and teaching the doctrine of dress, there will always be opponents to criticize or denigrate this precept rejected by their carnal hearts, these agents who always resist the Holy Spirit, are the majority, tread the broad path and it's been a long time, but,</font></font></p>
		
		
<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In all ages a majority of the professed followers of Christ have disregarded those precepts which command self-denial and humility, which require modesty and simplicity of conversation, conduct, and dress. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The result has always been the same—a departure from evangelical teachings leads to the adoption of worldly fashions, customs, and principles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vital piety gives way to dead formalism. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The presence and power of God, drawn from the loving circles of the world, meet with a class of humble worshipers willing to obey the teachings of the Holy Word. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Through successive generations this orientation has been followed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One after another the different denominations have arisen and, abandoning simplicity, have largely lost their primitive power.</font></font><br>

<blockquote> 
<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">God's people have, to a great extent, lost their distinguishing features, gradually modeling themselves after the world and mingling with it, until in many respects they become like it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This displeases God. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He leads them, as he led the children of Israel of old, to come out of the world and forsake their idolatrous practices, not following their own heart (for that is not sanctified) or their vision, which has led them away from God and united them to the world. </font></font><br>

<div align="justify"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have been shown that balloon skirts are an abomination, and the influence of every Sabbathkeeper must be a rebuke to this ridiculous fashion, which has been a display of iniquity, and which has arisen from a house of ill repute in Paris. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have been shown women who will despise instruction, </font></font><span class="style20"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">even if it comes from heaven</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They will invent some excuse to avoid direct witness, and in defiance of all the light given they will wear balloon skirts because it is fashionable, at the risk of the consequences. </font></font><br>
